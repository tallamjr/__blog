All git repos are now hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com).

Previously private repos were hosted on our web server.  However, upgrading the server regularly breaks the git hosting system (thanks Apple for continually making breaking changes!).

I've therefore migrated all git repos to GitHub.  So now, not only are the public repos hosted on GitHub, but so too are the private ones.

To keep the distinction between private and public repos, all private repos are prefixed with `src_`, `doc_`, or `wiki_`, for codes, papers and wikis, respectively.

You can find all repos at [https://github.com/astro-informatics](https://github.com/astro-informatics).
