# About Me

style="float: right;margin: 0px 0px 10px 15px;">

My name is Tarek Allam Jr,

I am a third year PhD student at the Centre for Data Intensive Science at
University College London (UCL). My research focus is on development of online
algorithms for real time classification of Astrophysical transient events.

I am also a SSI Fellow for 2020 where I advocate for better software engineering
best practises within the research community and provide technical training on
essential data science tools.

Although my current focus is on time series analysis and the deployment of such
machine learning systems into production, I have a keen interest in Theoretical
Physics stemming from my undergraduate studies in Astrophysics and I also have a
passion for Computer Vision which came from my masters studies in Computer Science.


# About The Blog

This blog is intended to be more of a series of rambling than a coherent
chronological account of technology I use or find interesting.

I suspect this may change over time but for now it will be rather "chaotic"
shall we say.
