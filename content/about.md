# About Me

<img src="/blog/img/profile-pic-smile-square-crop.jpg" style="float: right;margin: 0px 0px 10px 15px;">

My name is Tarek Allam Jr,

I am a third year PhD student at the Centre for Data Intensive Science at
University College London (UCL). My research focus is on development of online
algorithms for real time classification of Astrophysical transient events.

As part of my PhD I completed an internship at the Alan Turing Institute, where
I contributed to an exciting project which investigated machine learning methods
that could be applied to the domain of Air Traffic Control to help with
effective decision making. To learn more about this project, you can read more
[here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/decision-making-under-uncertainty-air-traffic-control)
or, since the majority of the work is open source, check out the project on
[Github](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/simurgh)

I am also a SSI Fellow for 2020 where I advocate for better software engineering
best practises within the research community and provide technical training on
essential data science tools.

Although I currently work on time series analysis and the deployment of such
machine learning systems into production, I have a keen interest in Theoretical
Physics stemming from my undergraduate studies in Astrophysics and I also have a
passion for Computer Vision which comes from my masters studies in Computer Science.

# About The Blog

<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/blogging.png" style="float: right;margin: 0px 0px 10px 15px;">

This blog is intended to be more of a series of ramblings than a coherent
chronological account of technology I use or find interesting.

I suspect this may change over time but for now it will be rather "chaotic"
shall we say.

Expect there to be snippets from my time as a PhD student as well as discussions
and thoughts I have had whilst being an SSI Fellow. I may also diverge into
topics of Applied Mathematics and Computer Vision as I these are areas I am
truly fascinated by and exited for what the future holds for such fields.
